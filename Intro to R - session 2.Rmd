In this session, we will learn how to manipulate and visualize data using the dplyr and ggplot packages

##Install packages
First, we need to intall the tidyverse package, which contains a siut of packages that makes data wrangling and visualization a lot easier!

```{r}
#Install the package. You can use the function below (install.packages) to install any package. Alternativelly, if you are using R studio, you can go to Tools>Install Packages and just selct the package you which to install
install.packages(tidyverse)

#Next, you need to upload the package to the library to make all functions available to use
library(tidyverse)
```

##Download data

First, lets download a database that we can work with. We will use a database from the world bank that estimates the prevalence of child malnutrition in the world. This data provides an estimate of the proportion of children under-five whose weight for age is less than minus two standard deviations from the median for the international reference population ages 0 to 59 months.

```{r}
#First, lets download the WDI (World development Indicators) package
install.packages(WDI)
library(WDI)

#Dowload the data we want. Lets name the database "dat"
dat = WDI(country = "all", indicator = c("malnut" = "5.51.01.02.malnut"), start=2005, end=2011, extra=TRUE, cache=NULL)

#Now lets inspect the data
names(df)
head(df)
str(df)

#As we can see, this is a data frame containing 1078 observations and 11 variables, where "malnut" is the main variable that we are interested in.
```

#Tidy data

To work with tidyverse packages, we need to use a data frame in the long (tidy) format, where we put variables in the columns and observations in the rows. Many databases will be in the wide format, so it is important to make sure that you are working with a dataset in the long format.

An examples of wide format data is:

```{r}
##      ozone      wind     temp
## 1 23.61538 11.622581 65.54839
## 2 29.44444 10.266667 79.10000
## 3 59.11538  8.941935 83.90323
## 4 59.96154  8.793548 83.96774
```

The same data in the long format would be:

```{r}
##    variable     value
## 1     ozone 23.615385
## 2     ozone 29.444444
## 3     ozone 59.115385
## 4     ozone 59.961538
## 5      wind 11.622581
## 6      wind 10.266667
## 7      wind  8.941935
## 8      wind  8.793548
## 9      temp 65.548387
## 10     temp 79.100000
## 11     temp 83.903226
## 12     temp 83.967742
```

There are many ways to transform databases from wide to long and long to wide formats. You can use the dplyr package functions gather() for transforming from wide to long and spread() to transform from long to wide. Another option (which I find easier) is to use the reshape2 package functions melt() and dcast().

Since our data is already in the long (tidy) format, we will move on. But see the supplemental material if you would like to explore this further.

##Dplyr basic data wrangling functions

There are six main functions the we can use to do the majority of data manipulations:

- **`filter()`**: pick observations by their values
    
- **`select()`**: pick variables by their names
    
- **`mutate()`**: create new variables with functions of existing variables 

- **`group_by()`**: changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group
    
- **`summarise()`**: collapse many values down to a single summary 
  
- **`arrange()`**: reorder the rows

The first argument of any function is the data frame and the subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame.

#Filter

This function allows you to subset your data for specific countries, years, etc.

First, lets filter only data from Madagascar:
```{r}
filter(dat, country %in% "Madagascar")

#now we could take the mean Malnutrition proportion from 2005 to 2011
x = filter(dat, country %in% "Madagascar")
mean(x$malnut)
```

Lets filter data only from Madagascar and Mozambique. For this we will have to use the `%in%` operator:

```{r}
filter(dat, country %in% c("Madagascar", "Mozambique"))
```

Now, lets filter for Madagascar and for values greater than 0.8

```{r}
filter(dat, country == "Madagascar", malnut>0.8)
```

#Select

This funciton allows you to subset the data on variables or columns.

```{r}
#Lets subset the data so that it shows only columns iso3c, year and malnut
x = select(dat, iso3c, year, malnut)
head(x)
#See that our dataset has now only 3 variables
```
```{r}
#Now, lets remove longitude and latitude (we might not be interested in those columns)
x = select(dat, -longitude, -latitude)
head(x)
#See now that we have 9 columns (instead of 11)
```

#Using the pipe `%>%` operator

This new syntax leads to code that is much easier to write and to read. You can think "and then" whenever you see the pipe operator, `%>%`
The RStudio keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + M (Windows), Cmd + Shift + M (Mac).

```{r}
#Lets do the same example as above. Now instead of including the data frame inside the function, we will use the pipe operator:

#Instead of doing this:
x = filter(dat, country == "Madagascar", malnut>0.8)

#You can now do this:
x = dat %>% 
  filter(country == "Madagascar", 
         malnut>0.8)
head(x)
```

Now, you can combine two different functions:

```{r}
dat %>% 
  filter(country == "Madagascar") %>% 
  select(iso3c, year, malnut)
##This is an important, since most manipulations will have more than one operations. 
#You can read this as: "from the data frame "dat", filter for Madagascar and then select variables iso3c, year and malnut"
```

#Mutate

Now lets say we want to add a new column to our data frame. This function allows you to change existing variables or create new ones.

```{r}
#Lets say we want a column that is the percentage of child malnutrition instead of proportions. To do that, we need to multiply the malnut variable by 100. Let call this new variable perc_malnut

dat %>%
  mutate(perc_malnut = malnut*100) %>% 
  filter(country == "Madagascar")
#Now we have one more column that is perc_malnut
```

#Group by and summarise
What if we wanted to know the average "malnut" value per year for all countries? Answering this question requires a grouping variable.

By using `group_by()` we can set our grouping variable to year and create a new column called `mean_malnut` that will calculate the mean malnut value for each year accross all countries in our dataset.

The function `summarize()` will only keep the columns that are grouped_by or summarized. You can also use this to sum accross rows by using `sum()` instead of `mean()`

```{r}
dat %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_malnut = mean(malnut, na.rm = T)) #you need to include na.rm = TRUE when you have NA's in the data.

#Now we can see the world average child malnutrition estimates per year!
```

We can also group by more than one variable. Lets say we want to know thw average malnut value per year by income level.

```{r}
dat %>%
  group_by(year, income) %>% 
  summarise(mean_malnut = mean(malnut, na.rm = T)) #you need to include na.rm = TRUE when you have NA's in the data.

#Now we can see the world average child malnutrition estimates per year!
```



#Arrange

This funciton allows you to arrange the data according to any specific variable. For example, you might want to arrange the output from the previous example by the mean_malnut value, instead of years.

```{r}
dat %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_malnut = mean(malnut, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(mean_malnut)
```

You can also arrange the data in descending order:

```{r}
dat %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_malnut = mean(malnut, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_malnut))
```

Lets now use all functions together!

Your turn: lets say we want to know the average malnut value (in percentage) in Sub-Saharan Africa countries from 2005 to 2011 in ascending order.

```{r}
dat %>%
  filter(region == "Sub-Saharan Africa") %>% 
  mutate(perc_malnut = 100*malnut) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_malnut = mean(perc_malnut, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(mean_malnut)
```




#Exercise 3

Write a function for the MPA model we constructed in exercise 2. For this model, our parameters will be $t$, $K$, $d$, $L$, $g$, $f$ and $MPA$. The parameter $MPA$ will be a value representing the percent in MPA of our model (from 0 to 100). Your should transform this MPA value into a vector of fishing mortalities, where patches designated as MPA have a value of $f=0$. Set $d=0.2$; $L=100$; $g=0.5$, $K=100$, $t=50$, and initial population of 50 individuals 

**a**) Calculate yield and population sizes for all MPA values (0, 1, 2..., 100). Test MPA effectiveness for fishing mortality values for patches open to fishing of $f=0.3$ and $f=0.6$. 

Plot:  
1) Total population size (all patches) in year t for all MPA sizes and both fishing mortalities  
2) Total yield (all patches) in year t for all MPA sizes and both fishing mortalities  

Answer:  
1) Does MPA improve system-wide fishing yield?
2) What is the optimal MPA size for both fishing mortalities?  
2) How does the answer from 2) change if $d=0.5$?

**b**) Calculate the optimal MPA size for different mobility values. Set $f=0.6$ for all patches open to fisheries and test a range of $d$ values (0, 0.1, 0.2...., 1) and MPA sizes (0, 1, 2..., 100). Optimal MPA size is defined as the percent in MPA that gives the maximum yield in year t. 

Plot:  
1) optimal MPA size for different values of d

**c**) Now lets test for a different MPA location. Instead of the MPA be located on the edge of the string of patches (in the case of exercise 2 the patches on the right), lets set the MPA in the middle. Make the same plot of **b**.
